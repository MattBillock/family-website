# Greetings!

This is my personal home page and place to hack. If you find this useful you probably fall into one of two buckets. You're either politely viewing my source code after a conversation we had. In which case, thank you for taking a look, and please feel free to open issues or issue PRs! I'm always looking for ways to improve

Otherwise, you are a potential colleague, client, or employer, in which case - welcome! I wanted a better showpiece to serve as my online portfolio, so I built this repo here. My primary experience is back-end focused, and with backgrounds in C++ and Rails development that's probably to be expected. As such my front-end portfolio is a little underwhelming.

Since I am doing more front end work lately, I'm working on this to build a personal hobby site that I can test various technologies with. Right now I'm focused on React, AWS Lambda, WebGL, and some random non-related tech items (Music, game dev, etc). My strongest languages are Ruby and Python, and I have a long background in C++.
